# Mozilla Ignite Learning Lab 6: Software Defined Networking

Status: In-progress

So you want to get started with Software Defined Networking (SDN),
the future of networking?

This is a tutorial project you can use to get quickly up and running
with a homebrew SDN network at home.

Before you get started, with our DIY video, where we build an OpenFlow
network in a suburban garage: http://example.com

## Pre-requisites

- Python 2.7+: http://www.python.org/getit/
- An openflow-capable router/switch, like: http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WR1043ND-Ultimate-Wireless-Gigabit/dp/B002YLAUU8
- Some spare computers (desktops, laptops, Raspberry Pis)
- Pioneer spirit

## Setup (To Be Revised)

1. Plug in your router
2. Connect to it via ethernet
3. Log in
4. Flash the firmware with OpenWRT + Openflow
5. SSH into your router
6. Configure your router
7. Copy this entire project onto your router-connected computer
8. Start reading `tutorials/0-setup.md` in this project
